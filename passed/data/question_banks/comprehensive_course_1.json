Aristotle on friendship\n翻译: 对于亚里士多德而言，友情可以分为三类：实用型友情、愉悦型友情和美德型友情。实用型友情的基础是双方能够相互利用。愉悦型友情视双方所能获得的快乐多少而定。实用型友情和愉悦型友情都允许一个人有很多位朋友，而美德型友情与这两种关系不同，只能存在于一对一的关系里。只有两个个人德行一致（或非常相似），且都是品格高尚的人，才能发展这种美德型友情。\n\nB. Confucius on friendship\n翻译: Confucius says: \"There are three kinds of friendship that are helpful, while other three that are harmful. Friendship with the upright, the honest and the learned is helpful. Friendship with the wicked, the flatterers and the glib-tongued is harmful.\""

Among others, by improving your EQ and charisma effect you'll certainly enhance your personal image.\n\nBy improving your EQ, you make yourself amiable and reliable. The core is to make sure that others are comfortable with you - the way you dress, the air you speak in, the manner you converse in, and the opinion you utter. Find some value from others' opinions, and make others feel they are important. Thus they are more likely depend upon you.\n\nMeanwhile, you must be a strong person to whom others turn in times of trouble and uncertainty. You must define a goal for your team and never give up.

The compass, originally called Sinan, a south-pointing ladle, appeared during the Warring States Period. Generally, the directions of north, east, west and south are showing on the compass, and so are the angle markings in degrees. North corresponds to zero degree, and the degrees increase clockwise. As one of the four great inventions of ancient China, the compass played an important role in people's life, especially in maritime undertakings. It also had a significant influence on the Western world, as thereafter those countries began large-scale overseas adventure."
